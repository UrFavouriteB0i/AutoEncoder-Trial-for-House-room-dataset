# AutoEncoder-Trial-for-House-room-dataset
## Project Overview

This repository contains a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) model trained on a dataset of 5000 house room images (living room, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen). The goal of this project is to reconstruct high-quality 32x32 pixel RGB images using the CAE.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 5000 images categorized into four classes: living room, bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen.

## Model Architecture

The CAE architecture is composed of:

Encoder: A series of convolutional layers with decreasing feature maps and increasing receptive fields to extract relevant features.
Decoder: A series of transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct the input image from the latent representation.
Training Process

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

## Results

The current model achieves a loss of 0.52. Further improvements may be possible by:

Pre-training: Using a pre-trained model as a starting point.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Data Augmentation: Increasing the dataset size and diversity through techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping.
Future Work

Denoising Autoencoder: Explore using a denoising autoencoder to improve robustness to noise and artifacts.
Variational Autoencoder (VAE): Implement a VAE to generate new, realistic images of house rooms.
Supervised Learning: Use the learned representations from the autoencoder as features for a supervised classification task.
