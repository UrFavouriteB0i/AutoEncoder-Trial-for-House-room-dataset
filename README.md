# AutoEncoder-Trial-for-House-room-dataset
House rooms dataset consist of 5000 images set of living, bath, bed, kitchen room </br>
I'm using Convolutional Autoencoder for recreating RGB image for 32 x 32 pixel </br>
Result still has 0.52 loss but further change such as adding a pretrained weight may increase the detail accuracy
